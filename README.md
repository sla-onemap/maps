## Synopsis

Leaflet-Providers provide a good way to call maps on the fly. As One Map 2.0 progresses, we wish to simplify the way you call our maps. Hence, we have added our maps into Stefan Seelmann (leaflet-providers).


## Code Example

From our index.html, you would be able to see the ease of calling our maps via a single line of code.

These are the various calls for four different maps:

									L.tileLayer.provider('OneMap.Default')
									L.tileLayer.provider('OneMap.Original')
									L.tileLayer.provider('OneMap.Night'),
									L.tileLayer.provider('OneMap.Grey')

## Motivation

Make life simple for you. ;>

## API Reference

If you really like our maps. Do visit http://docs.onemap.sg/maps/ for maps. For REST services http://docs.onemap.sg .


## Contributors

One Map 2.0 Dev Team modified the version for ease of calling.
